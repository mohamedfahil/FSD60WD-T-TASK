Blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

     Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes 
(i.e.)
           *number
           *string
           *boolean etc..

Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

2)    Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types
          *Number
          *String
          *Boolean
          *null
          *undefined and symbol)
 in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).


Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal:
     
     One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces are

let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'BMW s1000rr', engine:'999cc'};






Internal Representation of Objects:

    Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently. 
One common approach is using a hash table or a similar structure to store the object’s properties and their corresponding values. 
This allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.
